Yes, you are seeing correctly: Korobi now has a blog where you will find news
about our updates, development insights, silly anecdotes about the horrible
stuff I wrote, everything!

And just because I'm so cool :bowtie:, I wrote two themes for it. That way, you
can all enjoy both a dark theme and a light theme.

The blog uses [Jekyll][jekyll] with a custom theme and is hosted using [GitHub
Pages][gh-pages] going through [CloudFlare][cloudflare]. The comment section is
powered by [Disqus][disqus] and we'll try to hang out in there to answer your
possible questions (though you probably have better chances to get a quick answer
on IRC if we're awake).

[gh-pages]:   https://pages.github.com/
